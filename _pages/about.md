💻🧠 I am an AI Engineer with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

🧬🔬 My background is in Biotech Engineering and Nanobiology (biophysics x10<sup>-9</sup>).

🦠🔍 Naturally, I am very keen on leveraging AI to uncover biological insights.

📖👁️ Currently, my main interests lie in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.

🤓 Feel free to take a look at my [Blog Posts](https://rgonzlin.github.io/year-archive/), including my [latest](https://rgonzlin.github.io/posts/blog-post-1/) discussing how state-of-the-art models (mainly transformers) are revolutionizing protein folding prediction and de novo protein design.
